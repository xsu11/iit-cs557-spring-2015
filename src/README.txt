We develop a Water Tracking Android app.

1. The apk file (Android app file) is /WaterTracking/bin/wt_li_190f_25c.apk

2. Send the apk file to an Android smart phone (Android 4.0 and above), then install the app on the phone.

3. After installation, open the app, you can see there are two buttons, Start and Stop (with Stop button disabled). The first phase is training. Before do the movement, press the Start button , then the app start to record the data. Now the Start button is disabled and Stop is enabled. You should start to perform the movement. When you are done, press the Stop button to stop the app recording. In the end, it will show you the result at the bottom of the app. After the training phase, it will come into the test phase to show the prediction of the moment you act. During the training phase, the result will show “TRAINING DATA XX” (XX represents to the number you perform the movement), while during the test phase it will show the predicted result (TRUE/FALSE)

4. If you perform a too short movement, the app will not record enough sample points. Then it will show error.
